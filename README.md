# race-track-car-firmware

Firmware for ESP32-Cam mounted to an RC car to be used with the [Race Track Orchestration](https://github.com/OlliePugh/race-track-orch)

I have powered this by using an 18350 Battery mounted into a UPS board on the car along with a 120 degree camera over the default camera to give a wider FOV
